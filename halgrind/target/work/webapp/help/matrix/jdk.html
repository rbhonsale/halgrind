<div>
  Specify the JDK(s) with which builds are performed. If none is selected,
  the default JDK is used (no explicit <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt>, and <tt>java</tt> command
  is assumed to be in <tt>PATH</tt>.) If multiple JDKs are selected,
  the configuration matrix will include all of the specified JDKs.
  <br>
  Selecting multiple values is typically useful when this job is running tests,
  and you need to run tests on multiple different versions of JDKs.
  <br>
  During a build, the selected JDK value for the given run is available as the "jdk" axis.
  See the help of "axes" below for more information about how to access the axis value.
