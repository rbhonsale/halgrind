<div>
  If configured, the regular expression will be applied to all job names.
  Those that match the regular expression will be shown in this view.
  Tip: to <em>exclude</em> certain patterns, use negative lookahead.
  For example, to display all jobs not named <samp>test<i>something</i></samp>,
  use: <samp>(?!test.*).*</samp>
