    If you have multiple views defined, then the default Views TabBar becomes too long. The ViewsToolBar
    Extension Point provides facility for plugins to provide their own implementation of Views TabBar.
    This DropDown, lists all the available Views TabBar implementation. Only one TabBar implementation can
    be active at a time. Select one from the DropDown list.
