<div>
  For projects that use Maven as the build system. This causes Hudson to
  invoke Maven with the given goals and options. A non-zero exit code from
  Maven makes Hudson mark the build as a failure.
  Some Maven versions have a bug where it doesn't return the exit code correctly.

  <p>
  Hudson passes <a href="../../env-vars.html" target="_new">
  various environment variables</a> to Maven, which you can access from Maven as "${env.VARIABLENAME}".

  <p>
  The same variables can be used in command-line arguments (as if you are invoking this from shell).
  For example, you can specify <tt>-DresultsFile=${WORKSPACE}/${BUILD_TAG}.results.txt</tt>
