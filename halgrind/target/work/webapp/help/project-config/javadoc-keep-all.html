<div>
    If you check this option, Hudson will retain Javadoc for each successful build.
    This allows you to browse Javadoc for older builds, at the expense of additional
    disk space requirement.

    <p>
    If you leave this option unchecked, Hudson will only keep the latest Javadoc,
    so older Javadoc will be overwritten as new builds succeed.
