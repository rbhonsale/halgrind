<div>
  If set, a newly scheduled build waits for this many seconds before actually being built.
  This is useful for:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Collapsing multiple CVS change notification e-mails into one (some CVS changelog
      e-mail generation scripts generate multiple e-mails in quick succession when
      a commit spans across directories).
    </li>
    <li>
      If your coding style is such that you commit one logical change in a few cvs/svn
      operations, then setting a longer quiet period would prevent Hudson from building
      it prematurely and reporting a failure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Throttling builds. If your Hudson installation is too busy with too many builds,
      setting a longer quiet period can reduce the number of builds.
    </li>
  </ul>
  If not explicitly set at project-level, the system-wide default value is used.
  <p>
  It's possible to use Project cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Project+cascading">
  this document</a>.
