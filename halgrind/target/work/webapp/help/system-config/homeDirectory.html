<div>
  Hudson stores all the data files inside this directory in the file system.
  You can change this by either:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Using your web container's admin tool to set the <tt>HUDSON_HOME</tt>
      environment entry.
    <li>
      Setting the environment variable <tt>HUDSON_HOME</tt> before launching
      your web container.
    <li>
      (Not recommended) modifying web.xml in <tt>hudson.war</tt> (or its expanded image
      in your web container).
  </ol>
  This value cannot be changed while Hudson is running.
  This entry is mostly for you to make sure that your configuration is taking effect.
