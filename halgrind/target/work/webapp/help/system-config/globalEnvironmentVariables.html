<div>
    These key-value pairs apply for every build on every node. They can be used in Hudson's
    configuration (as $key or ${key}) and will be added to the environment
    for processes launched from the build in addition to the
    <a href="env-vars.html" target="_new">globally predefined values</a> created
        by Hudson itself or a plugin.
