<div>
  Optional human-readable description of this slave. This information
  is displayed on the project configuration screen.

  <p>
  When you have slaves that are different from others, it's often helpful
  to use this field to explain what is different. For example, entering
  "Windows slave" in this field would allow project owners to choose to
  always build on a Windows machine (for example, if they need some
  Windows-specific build tool.)
